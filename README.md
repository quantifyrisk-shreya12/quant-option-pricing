# üßÆ Option Pricing and Computational Techniques in Quantitative Finance

This project contains hands-on implementations of key numerical methods used in quantitative finance for pricing financial derivatives. It spans theoretical models like **Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR)** and **Black-Scholes**, and extends to advanced computational techniques such as the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** for pricing options.

## üìÅ Notebooks Overview

- **Week 02 - Chapter 2**:  
  Introduction to option pricing using the CRR binomial tree method for European options. Parameterized pricing and plotting included.
  
- **Week 03 - Chapter 2 & 3**:  
  Comparison of CRR with the Black-Scholes model. Covers integral-based pricing and numerical validation of results.

- **Week 06 - Chapter 4**:  
  Transform-based methods including Laplace and Fourier transforms. FFT applied to compute option prices across a range of strikes efficiently.
